2512-Tumor Growth Simulations Project

Description: Tumor Growth Simulations in Response to Immunotherapy

Here, we have adopted mathematical models inspired by Yin et al., (2019) and Chappell et al., (2015) to generate tumor growth simulations. The models adopted are Exponential Growth, Logistic Growth, Gompertz Growth and Angiogenesis Growth Models and the simulations are run for an arbitrary amount of time. In order to introduce stochastic behaviour into the growth models using poisson distribution. Immunotherapy effects are shown in the plots and Monte Carlo Simulation is generated using varying parameter values to appreciate the bandwidth of the tumor growth in the even that there were maniputations to the parameter values.
